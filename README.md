# Welcome to my project ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

### Mandatory tasks:
- [x] The logo spills out of its designated area.
- [x] TEC theme is not displayed on the header bar instead a green color is seen.
- [x] Users screen does not display any data.
- [x] Load more button style is not working.
- [x] Style issues are encountered on the page - style however you want.
- [x] Additional data is not displayed upon using "Load more" button.
- [x] Users are not filtered by gender and the list does not reset on change checkbox.
- [x] No loading state is displayed when accessing "Users" component.
- [x] On home page user should be able to do the following actions with cards that contain 2 fields: Title and Description

## Aditional Cool Features (Because Why Not? ðŸ˜Ž):
 - Automatic Description Generation: If a card is created with an empty description, the app calls an API to fill it with a random Chuck Norris fact. Because Chuck Norris always knows what to say! ðŸ¥‹ðŸ’¬

 - Emoji Magic: Hit the "Add Emojis" button, and an API will sprinkle some emoji magic into your descriptions. ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ Whether itâ€™s happy, sad, or something in between, thereâ€™s an emoji for that.

 - Stylish Users List: The users list now looks as sleek as the new Android Studio. Modern, intuitive, and easy on the eyes. ðŸ˜Ž
